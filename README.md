# < SVG Logo Generator > ![License](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=license&message=MIT&color=yellowgreen) 


## Description
This is a Node.js command-line application that generates simple logos based on user input and saves them as SVG files. My motivation was to illustrate my programming abilities and learn more about Node.js, and to create a tool that can generate logos quickly and easily. This application eliminates the need for users to create simple placehholder logos manually, saving them time and effort. 

Through this project, I was able to demonstrate how to work with user input, manipulate SVG files, and develop a command-line application using Node.js.
